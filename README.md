# Scoop Bucket

My personal [Scoop](https://github.com/lukesampson/scoop) bucket.

	$ scoop bucket add TheRandomLabs https://github.com/TheRandomLabs/Scoop-Bucket.git

Note that the installer for QTTabBar shows a dialog that requires user input.
It may also show an error related to start menu items, which can be ignored.
Put it last in your setup scripts!
