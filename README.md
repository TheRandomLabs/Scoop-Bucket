# Scoop Bucket

My personal [Scoop](https://github.com/lukesampson/scoop) bucket. I generally only keep manifests
here if there is something that is likely to make them unfit for any of the known buckets.

	$ scoop bucket add TheRandomLabs https://github.com/TheRandomLabs/Scoop-Bucket.git

## Customizing Spotify

First, the latest version of Spotify should be installed:

    $ scoop install spotify-latest

Note that Spotify should not be installed globally, as it stores files in user-specific directories.

Once Spotify is installed, [spicetify-cli](https://github.com/khanhas/spicetify-cli) can be
installed to customize the Spotify client:

    $ scoop install spicetify-cli

Again, spicetify-cli should be installed locally, as it also stores files in a user-specific
location.

[spicetify-themes](https://github.com/morpheusthewhite/spicetify-themes) can be installed for
a collection of community-created themes for Spicetify. Obviously, this should also be installed
locally:

	$ scoop install spicetify-themes

[google-spicetify](https://github.com/khanhas/google-spicetify) is also available:

	$ scoop install google-spicetify

I can recommend the
[Adapta-Nokto](https://github.com/morpheusthewhite/spicetify-themes/tree/master/Adapta-Nokto)
theme, which can be applied by running the following:

	$ spicetify config current_theme Adapta-Nokto
	$ spicetify apply

I can also recommend the
[Nord](https://github.com/morpheusthewhite/spicetify-themes/tree/master/Nord) theme,
which can be applied by running the following:

	$ spicetify config current_theme Nord
	$ spicetify apply

I also like the
[Elementary](https://github.com/morpheusthewhite/spicetify-themes/tree/master/Elementary) theme,
which requires Open Sans and Raleway to be installed:

	$ scoop bucket add nerd-fonts
	$ sudo scoop install Open-Sans Raleway
	$ spicetify config current_theme Elementary
	$ spicetify apply

To install spicetify-cli and apply a theme silently, the theme can be configured before installing
spicetify-themes. When any of the Spicetify packages are installed, the current configuration
is applied, and if Spotify was open previously, it is reopened.

	$ scoop install spicetify-cli
	$ spicetify config current_theme Elementary
	$ scoop install spicetify-themes

[genius-spicetify](https://github.com/khanhas/genius-spicetify) can be installed to fetch lyrics
from Genius or Musixmatch:

	$ scoop install genius-spicetify

BlockTheSpot can be installed to block advertisements:

	$ scoop install blockthespot

All of the above packages can be updated through Scoop.

If you don't care about reading any of this and just want a quick way to install ad-blocked Spotify
with the Elementary theme, genius-spicetify and developer tools, copy and paste this into
PowerShell:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser -Force
Invoke-Expression (New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://get.scoop.sh')
scoop install git sudo
scoop bucket add nerd-fonts
scoop bucket add TheRandomLabs https://github.com/TheRandomLabs/Scoop-Bucket.git
sudo scoop install spotify-latest Open-Sans Raleway
scoop install spicetify-cli
spicetify config current_theme Elementary
scoop install spicetify-themes genius-spicetify
spicetify enable-devtool
scoop install blockthespot
```

The reason BlockTheSpot is installed last above is because running `spicetify enable-devtool` would
reset it otherwise, which would require `blockthespot` to be run additionally at the end.

## Notes

### AOMEI Partition Assistant Standard

* The installer and uninstaller open a webpage upon completion.

### BlockTheSpot

* This blocks advertisements for the latest version of Spotify.
* BlockTheSpot depends on `spotify-latest` and should thus be installed locally.
* This is not an executable program. `spotify-latest` will be patched automatically every time this
package or any of the Spicetify packaages are installed or updated.
* If BlockTheSpot is ever reset, `blockthespot` can be run to reapply it. This usually happens
after running Spicetify commands, and running `spicetify-apply` rather than `spicetify apply`
ensures that BlockTheSpot is enabled if it is installed.

### Corsair iCUE

* `scoop uninstall corsair-icue` should not be run as administrator until
[this](https://github.com/lukesampson/scoop/issues/2952#issuecomment-542531849) is resolved.
* This means that `scoop update corsair-icue` also cannot be run as administrator and will show
two UAC dialogs.
* Alternatively, the following commands can be run prior to running
`scoop uninstall corsair-icue` or `scoop update corsair-icue` as administrator:

```powershell
$icue_path = "$(Split-Path(scoop prefix corsair-icue))\*"
Get-Process | Where-Object { $_.Path -Like "$icue_path" } | Stop-Process -Force
```

### Custom Resolution Utility

* This is the same as `cru` from the `extras` bucket, but it also has better shortcuts and shims.

### FFmpeg for Audacity

* This version (2.2.11) is more up-to-date than the one found in
[rasa's bucket](https://github.com/rasa/scoops) (2.2.2).
* It should also be noted that LAME now comes packaged with Audacity and therefore no longer has
to be installed separately.

### genius-spicetify

* genius-spicetify should be installed locally and not globally.
* genius-spicetify requires Spotify to be installed.
* Installing or updating genius-spicetify automatically applies the Spicetify configuration and
preserves BlockTheSpot if it is installed.
* It should be noted that this is installed to `~\.spicetify\CustomApps` and not the `CustomApps`
directory in the spicetify-cli installation directory.
* See [here](https://github.com/khanhas/genius-spicetify#musicxmatch) to configure a custom
Musixmatch user token. `manifest.json` can be found at
`~\.spicetify\CustomApps\genius\manifest.json`.

### google-spicetify

* google-spicetify should be installed locally and not globally.
* google-spicetify requires Spotify to be installed.
* Installing or updating google-spicetify automatically applies the Spicetify configuration and
preserves BlockTheSpot if it is installed.
* It should be noted that this is installed to `~\.spicetify\Themes` and not the `Themes`
directory in the spicetify-cli installation directory.

### Luyten

* I'll PR this to the `extras` bucket once
[deathmarine/Luyten#175](https://github.com/deathmarine/Luyten/issues/175) is resolved.

### MuseScore Nightly with File Associations

* This is identical to `musescore-nightly` in the `versions` bucket, except that file associations
are automatically registered.
* This is a concept that I'd like to eventually expand to other manifests.

### Neovim Dev

* This is the same as `neovim-nightly` in the `versions` bucket, except that autoupdate is enabled.

### ShellExView

* This manifest is a slightly improved version of `shellexview` from the `nirsoft` bucket.

### spicetify-cli

* spicetify-cli should be installed locally and not globally.
* spicetify-cli requires Spotify to be installed.
* Installing or updating this package automatically applies the Spicetify configuration and
preserves BlockTheSpot if it is installed.
* Experimental features, fast user switching and all
[default extensions](https://github.com/khanhas/spicetify-cli/wiki/Extensions) apart from
Auto Skip Videos and Trash Bin are enabled by default.
* `spicetify-apply` is should be run instead of `spicetify apply` if BlockTheSpot is installed, as
it ensures that BlockTheSpot is enabled if it is installed.
* It should be noted that `spicetify-apply` also runs `spicetify restore` and `spicetify backup`
before running `spicetify apply` to ensure that changes are applied.

### spicetify-themes

* spicetify-themes should be installed locally and not globally.
* spicetify-themes requires Spotify to be installed.
spicetify-cli is declared as a dependency and is installed automatically.
* Installing or updating this package automatically applies the Spicetify configuration and
preserves BlockTheSpot if it is installed.
* It should be noted that this is installed to `~\.spicetify\Themes` and not the `Themes`
directory in the spicetify-cli installation directory.
* The [Elementary](https://github.com/morpheusthewhite/spicetify-themes/tree/master/Elementary)
theme requires the Open Sans and Raleway fonts:

```
$ scoop bucket add nerd-fonts
$ sudo scoop install Open-Sans Raleway
```

* The [ShadowCustom](https://github.com/morpheusthewhite/spicetify-themes/tree/master/ShadowCustom)
theme requires the Ubuntu font:

```
$ scoop bucket add nerd-fonts
$ sudo scoop install Ubuntu-NF
```

### Spotify with BlockTheSpot

* This is an outdated version of Spotify (1.1.4.197.g92d52c4f) with BlockTheSpot.
* Spotify's built-in updater is disabled.
* This should only be used if BlockTheSpot does not work with the latest version of Spotify.
* Spotify with BlockTheSpot should be installed locally and not globally.
* `scoop install spotify-blockthespot` must be run as administrator,
which can be done most easily using `sudo`.
* However, `scoop uninstall spotify-blockthespot` does not have to be run as administrator.
* This cannot be installed concurrently with `spotify-latest`.
* Installing or updating this package automatically applies the Spicetify configuration if it is
installed.

### Spotify (latest)

* This is the latest version of Spotify.
* Unlike [Ash258's version](https://github.com/Ash258/scoop-Ash258/blob/master/bucket/Spotify.json),
this version installs completely silently and to the Scoop directory.
* Spotify's built-in updater is disabled, and Scoop should be used to update it instead.
* Spotify should be installed locally and not globally.
* This cannot be installed concurrently with `spotify-blockthespot`.
* Installing or updating this package automatically applies the Spicetify configuration and
preserves BlockTheSpot if it is installed.

### QTTabBar

* The installer shows a dialog that requires user interaction.
* The installer may show an error related to start menu items. This can be safely ignored.

### Win10 Initial Setup Script

* This is a PowerShell script for the automation of routine setup tasks completed on fresh
installations of Windows.
* Default setup can be run via `default-win10-initial-setup`.
* See [here](https://github.com/Disassembler0/Win10-Initial-Setup-Script#advanced-usage)
for advanced usage.

### Windows SDK Signing Tools

* This is just `cert2spc.exe`, `makecat.exe` and `signtool.exe` extracted from the Windows SDK.
* This is useful for those who need to sign executables but have no need for the rest of the
Windows SDK.
